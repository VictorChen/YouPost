# YouPost

#### I spend a lot of time browsing through random videos on YouTube and here's a list of things that bug me:

1. I can't watch the video and read comments at the same time (I have to scroll down)
2. YouTube comments are full of spoilers. I have to make sure I read the comments AFTER I finished the video
3. When reading the comments after watching the video, it's hard to remember what scene a particular comment is talking about.

#### Here's where YouPost come in! YouPost puts the comments side by side with the video. When you post a comment, it will "tag" your comment with the current time of the video. At any given time, YouPost will ONLY show comments that are posted BEFORE the current time of the video. Here's some benefits:

1. I can watch the video and read/post comments at the same time! yay!
2. It will not show spoiler comments because only the comments from the start of the video to the current time are shown.
3. Comments are closely related to the current scene the video is playing. Don't understand something about the current scene? Read the comments!
